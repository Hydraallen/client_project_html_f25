            <h2>Behavioral Interviews</h2>
            <p>
                Behavioral interviews focus on how you've handled situations in the past. The STAR method (Situation,
                Task, Action, Result) is a proven framework to structure your answers effectively.

            <h2>Learning How to Negotiate Job Offers</h2>
            <p>
                Negotiating a job offer is an important skill that can impact your career trajectory and financial
                stability. Start by researching industry standards for salary and benefits. Be confident but respectful
                when discussing your expectations. Highlight your value and contributions to the company, and be
                prepared to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Remember, negotiation is not just about
                salaryâ€”it can include vacation days, professional development opportunities, and other perks.
