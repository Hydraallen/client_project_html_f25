            <h2>Behavioral Interviews</h2>
            <p>
                Behavioral interviews focus on how you've handled situations in the past. The STAR method (Situation,
                Task, Action, Result) is a proven framework to structure your answers effectively.

            <h2>Post-Interview Follow-Up</h2>
            <p>
                After your interview, it's important to leave a positive impression. Send a thank-you email to your
                interviewer within 24 hours. Reflect on the interview and identify areas for improvement for future
                opportunities.
